    **The Facebook button isn't working. I checked out the code on Github and tried problem solving, but wasn't able to fix it. Opened a new issue about it. Going to remove Facebook button until then, but would ultimately prefer to have the Facebook button. 

-Bootstrap???
    (Are you really going to use this to style stuff?)
