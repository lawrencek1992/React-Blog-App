# Coding Blog Created with Create-React-App

##### Built by: Kelly Lawrence
_If you like this work, I am seeking a front end developer/UI developer position. Please reach out to me if you'd like to work together._

### Installation

Clone the repository and use **node package manager** to install the coding blog. 

```bash
gh repo clone lawrencek1992/React-Blog-App
npm install 
```

### Usage

I used **Google firebase** for user authentication and database storage. If you want to use my code, you will need to set up your own project in firebase, and you will need to create your own **firebase.js** file with **your own firebase configuration information**. 

### Technologies Used: 

* Create-react-app
* React Hooks
* React Context
* Quill Rich Text Editor
* Font Awesome Icons
* Google Firebase
* React sharing buttons:

        _The Facebook button isn't working. I couldn't fix the code for it on Github, but did open an issue on the repository._
